## It is an entrepreneurship project demo.

It was contributed by Ziyi CHANG, Yunhao HU, Jingzhi FAN, Zhuolan CHENG, Shangfang DAI, Jingyang LUO, Senxue ZHANG in School of Information Resource Management, Renmin University of China.

It uses html as the front-end which has been decorated by CSS.

The dynamic effect of the page and the switching between the pages are implemented by JavaScript.

JavaScript is responsible for using Jquery to call back-end python functions (router) and communicate with the back-end through json data.

The back-end consists of database and router functions.
