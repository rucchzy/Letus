# Letus

## It is an entrepreneurship project demo.

Letus is a mobile phone app. It will match people with the same fitness needs, allowing people to meet for fitness. In addition, people can also book gyms and coaches, and there is a community to share fitness experiences and pictures. 

It was contributed by Ziyi CHANG, Yunhao HU, Jingzhi FAN, Zhuolan CHENG, Shangfang DAI, Jingyang LUO, Senxue ZHANG in School of Information Resource Management, Renmin University of China.

It uses html as the front-end which has been decorated by CSS.

The dynamic effect of the page and the switching between the pages are implemented by JavaScript.

JavaScript is responsible for using Jquery to call back-end python functions (router) and communicate with the back-end through json data.

The back-end consists of database and router functions.

More details can be found in the Function demonstration.ppt

Also, there are four short videos to show what it looks like on your phone.
